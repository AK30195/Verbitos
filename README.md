# Verbitos

This is a web application built to assist Spanish learners with mastering verb conjugations. It contains information about the various tenses and verb
conjugation patterns seen in Spanish. The site provides users with flashcards and a practice mode. The user can select which tenses or verb groups they would
like to focus on and the site will generate quizzes and flashcards from the database which match the parameters selected by the user.

The site is available here - https://verbitos.com/

I intend to add functionality to the site and to expand the database to include a more comprehensive selection of verbs.
Potential additions will include:
- Mode for practicing irregular verbs
- Extra articles and content for learners
- Spaced repetition functionality similar to Anki or similar tools
